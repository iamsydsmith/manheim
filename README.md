## Manheim Technology Apprenticeship Program
### Second Round Coding Challenge
##### Developer: [Sydney Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamsydneysmith)

For this coding challenge, I created a 20 question game with the questions pertaining to Manheim. A player starts the game by picking a numbered square. Once a player chooses a square, a dialog box pops up with a question on Manheim. If the player answers the question correctly, their score increases. If they answer the question incorrectly, their score stays the same. The player does this until there are no more boxes left on the board. At the end, they can see their final results.
